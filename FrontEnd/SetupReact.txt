1. Need Node version 16+. You can get this at nodejs.org 
2. In the terminal, run "npm create vite@latest" you can change latest to whatever version you want, I am using 4.1.0
    a. It will ask for a project name
    b. Select the React framework
    c. Then you run the following commands
        1. cd react-app
        2. npm install
3. Now you can run "npm run dev" which will give you the local version

Any questions feel free to ask Aiden!
